# Veivlet Site

Repository of Veivlet site.

## Usage

### 1. Install bundler

You must have bundler installed. If you already have bundler installed, please skip this step.

```bash
# Update Rubygems
$ gem update --system
# Update bundler
$ gem install bundler
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Site is built on Jekyll and uses its built-in SCSS compiler to generate our CSS. Before getting started, you'll need to install the Jekyll gem and related dependencies:

```bash
$ bundler install
```

### 3. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Poole applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from `/dark-poole` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†.

### 4. Serving it up

If you host your code on GitHub, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host your project.

1. Fork this repo and switch to the `gh-pages` branch.
1. If you're [using a custom domain name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages), modify the `CNAME` file to point to your new domain.
1. If you're not using a custom domain name, **modify the `url` in `_config.yml`** to point to your GitHub Pages URL. Example: for a site hosted at `username.github.io`, use `http://username.github.io`.
1. If you want to use your repo name as a base url, **set the `url`** to your repo link and **set the `baseurl`** to your repo name in **`_config.yml`**. Example: for site hosted on `https://username.github.io/dark-poole`, set `url` as `https://username.github.io/dark-poole` and `baseurl` as `/dark-poole`.
1. Done! Head to your GitHub Pages URL or custom domain.

No matter your production or hosting setup, be sure to verify the `baseurl` option file and `CNAME` settings. Not applying this correctly can mean broken styles on your site.

### 5. Pagination for sites with base urls

If you are using a base url for your site, (for example, hosted on `https://username.github.io/dark-poole`) you have to make some changes to get jekyll-pagination to work correctly:

In `_config.yml`, add this line:

```yaml
paginate_path: "/baseurl/page:num/"
```

In `archive.md`, add `{{ site.baseurl }}` before `{{ post.url }}`

```html
<!-- Add "{{ site.baseurl }}" -->
<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
```

In `index.html`, remove the `prepend:`:

```html
<!-- Remove "prepend:" in "prepend: relative_url" -->
<a
  class="pagination-item newer"
  href="{{ paginator.previous_page_path | relative_url }}"
  >Newer</a
>
```
